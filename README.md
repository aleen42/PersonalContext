## Personal Context

A repository for personal specific documentation formats that help AI agents (Antigravity, Cursor, Claude, Codex) understand and generate better code.

#### Antigravity

- [ ] [**`skills/`**](./skills/index.md): Directory containing `SKILL.md` (and optional `assets/`, `examples/`) to teach the agent specialized capabilities.
- [ ] **`.agent/workflows/`**: YAML-frontmatter markdown files defining step-by-step executable workflows.
- [ ] **`knowledge/`**: Curated knowledge items (KIs) distilled from conversations.

#### General (Claude, Codex, & Others)

- [x] [**`RULES.md`**](./RULES.md): Explicit coding rules, patterns, and constraints. It is also known as `AGENTS.md` in Cursor, while `CALUDE.md` in Calude Code.
- [ ] **`llms.txt`**: A summarized context file optimized for LLM consumption (emerging standard).
- [x] [**`.editorconfig`**](./.editorconfig): Enforces coding style (indentation, line endings) which AI models typically respect.
